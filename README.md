# [contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) and [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) Blog Template

Create a completely custom blog using the power of NextJs 🚀 and the flexibility of `contentlayer` 📑.

This repository is a template for a blog. It uses `contentlayer` to convert local [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) files to blog posts that are then imported and displayed using [nextjs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js).

## Structure
The repository is organized in modules.

The [`main`](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/nextjs-contentlayer-blog-template) branch contains the minimal configuration to get your blog up and running.

All [branches](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/nextjs-contentlayer-blog-template/branches) are designed to add some functionality on top of the basic setup. Some example of extra features that are generally found in a blog are:
- Sitemap
- Custom styling
- Private posts
- Favicons
- SEO

## Goal
As developers, we want full control over the content of our blog. Everything from styling, dark mode, layout, etc.

At the same time, we do not want to deal with too many implementation details, especially when it comes to local content, bundling, and configuration.

Fortunately, we have `contentlayer` to solve our needs for content, and `nextjs` that gives us full control over the implementation of our website.

**Using this template, you can forget about the underling details and just add features on top of a stable and solid setup**.

## Roadmap
Over time the repository will add more and more modules (branches) that implement common usecases.

Each branch will provided a guide on how to integrate a new feature into the basic template.
